# Investigate-a-Dataset-No-show-appointments-

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.<br> 
A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. <br>

## clarifications
<br>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.</li>
<li>‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.</li>
<li>‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.</li>
<li>Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.</li>
</ul>
